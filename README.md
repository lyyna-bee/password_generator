# 🔐 Password Generator (Python)

This is a collection of Python scripts I built while learning loops, conditionals, and randomization during Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code boot camp. 
Each file explores a different version of a password generator — from fixed-length passwords to user-driven options and randomization with or without repeats.

## 💡 Features
- Generate secure passwords with letters, numbers, and symbols
- Choose password length (minimum 8 characters)
- Option to generate multiple passwords at once
- Randomized character selection with or without repeats
- Input validation to prevent errors
- Recap file included for learning reference

## 📁 Files Included
- `Full password generator.py` — complete version with user input and multiple password generation
- `PG random length.py` — generates passwords with random lengths
- `PG random NO repeats.py` — uses `random.sample()` to avoid character repetition
- `PG random with repeats.py` — uses `random.choices()` to allow repeats
- `User-driven password length.py` — lets the user choose password length
- `Recap for day 5` — summary of key concepts learned

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3.10 or later installed.
2. Clone this repo or download the files.
3. Open any `.py` file in your IDE (like PyCharm).
4. Run the script and follow the prompts in the terminal.

## 🌱 Built With
- Python 3.10
- PyCharm IDE
- Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code boot camp (Day 5–6 concepts)

## 📚 What I Learned
- How to use `random.choices()` vs `random.sample()`
- How to validate user input with `while True` loops
- How to split password length across character types
- How to debug indentation and logic errors
- How to prepare for functions (coming next!)
